# Notes
This mod change the way Temperature in game work. However, it should be compatible with other mods and future updates
Characters can have its custom freezing temperature, as well as getting the freezing overlay warning before the actual freeze like overheating, no matter the seasons.
Warning overlay will always be at +5 / -5 of the character's freezing/overheating temperature
<br>

- He has custom speeches for Status Announcement. Along with other mods that he request.
Including: Wonder Why (Ancient Dreams - ACT II)

As for the beefalo taming, considers disable 30% faster taming or contacts me if it happens to break with game updates or other mods.
